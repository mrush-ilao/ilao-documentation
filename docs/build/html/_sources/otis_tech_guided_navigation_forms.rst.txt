Guided Navigation Forms
=============================


      
Understanding the Guided Navigation form object
==================================================

Each form has:

* a unique ID associated with it that appears to change with each invocation.  
* a set of elements that define the form
* an array of validation errors
* a boolean of is_complete.  When is_complete is TRUE, we've reached the end of the dialogue.
* a boolean of should_show_previous.  When TRUE, we can allow the user to go back a form page.

Elements
=============

The heart of the form is the elements.

Every (form) element has:

* a unique id
* a boolean to indicate whether there display logic.
* display_logic, which has data when has_display_logic is TRUE.
* a type.  Known supported types are field, headline



Fields
----------
Known supported field types are select, text, bool,

Form fields will have:
* a field_type which indicates the type of field 
* a value field
* validation_rules as an array, when the field has validation rules.
* a value.  This may be pre-filled with a default value from Guided Navigation.

Select
^^^^^^^^^^
A select field will have:

* a field_type of select
* an array of options.  Each option is an object with a value and a label.  The label is shown to the user while the value is stored and shared back to Guided Navigation.
* a boolean of is_multiple.  When this is true, the field is a multiselect and/or checkboxes.  When the value is false, the field is a single select or radio buttons.
* a value.  This may be pre-filled with a default value from Guided Navigation.

Text
^^^^^^^
* a field_type of text

Bool
^^^^^^
* a field_type of bool
* no options; these should be Yes, No with values of t and f





Non-field Elements
---------------------

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Instructions will have:

* a type of "instructions"
* an html_value
* may have display logic

Headline
^^^^^^^^^
A headline is just HTMl-formatted text. A headline will have:

* a type of headline
* an html_value 
* may have display logic



Display logic
---------------------

When the element's has_display_logic is true, the display_logic property will have data.  There are two use cases we have to be concerned with:

* Display logic dependent on a previous form submission
* Display logic dependent on a previous field submission in the current form.

The display_logic property will be an object with:
* a condition property. Expected values are AND, OR. When there are multiple rules, this condition sits between them
* a rules property.  This is an array of rules to test for
* a not boolean.  When this is true, the rules should be tested as NOT. 
* a valid boolean.  It is unclear what the purpose of this is.

Rules
^^^^^^^^
Rules is an array that contains the conditions to test against.  Each element in the array contains an object with:

* an id
* field, which represents the field to test against.  This can be found in the profile from Guided Navigation for a particular session
* type (known types: string)
* input
* operator.  Known types are contains, not_contains, equal, not_equal, begins_with, in, is_empty, is_not_empty,
* value.  This is either a string (for contains, not contains) or an array of values (for in operators)
* data.  For in operators, this is the data to test against.

In the above, the element would display if the field mr_service_area_49 had a value IN (1)



.. image:: ../assets/otis-gn-display-logic-complex.png

In the above, the element would display if the mr_ilao_legal_issue_58 had a value that contains 'end' OR'shut_off' OR 'no longer getting' OR 'shutoff'

Validation Rules
------------------

Validation rules for an element, if not empty, is an array of rules.

Each element is an object with a proprety of type.  A type of required is the most common and indicates that a form element should be required.
