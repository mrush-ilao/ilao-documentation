========================
User Dashboard Pages
========================

Each user has a profile, or dashboard, page.  The contents of that page vary depending on the role(s) the user has.

Community Members
====================
Our most limited role is the community member.  This role is given to any user who does not have any other role.

This dashboard shows:

* A block for their user profile
* A block for any referrals made via Get Legal Help
* A block for any toolboxes that are saved.

.. note::  Law students have the same dashboard as community members.

Staff Members
================
The staff dashboard is shown for anyone with the staff or intern role REGARDLESS of any other role they have.
