Common Elements
=================

All legal content, regardless of format:

* Requires a title
* Requires a meta description and is limited to 300 characters.  The meta description is used on communications outside of the website, including:

  * social media posts
  * eUpdates
  * RSS and API feeds
  * SERP snippets in our sitemap XML files
  
* Requires a content description and is limited to 200 characters.  The content description is used on the website for search results and related blocks.

* Requires one or more selections in the Navigational IA.  This is not used on the website (see :ref:`taxonomy-status-label`) yet but will replace the legal issues taxonomy for navigation through category/sub-category and form library pages.

* Requires one or more selections in the legal category.  This is used currently for navigation and for relating content and for linking content with OTIS/Get Legal Help.

* Requires a single selection for primary legal category.  This is where breadcrumbs should generate from when a user lands on a page.

* Add an image.  Images are not required but should be added as this is used for social media.  If the image is not added, a default image from the page (usually the contact us or fundraising icons will be used).

* Select zero or more annual updates. See :ref:`annual-updates-label` 

* Select the appropriate jurisdiction for the content.

* Select the legal position: Neutral, Plaintiff/petitioner, or Defendant/respondent depending on the content.

* Requires one or more content blocks.  See the individual format links above.  The types of content blocks used will determine the content format.  

* Requires a content level selection.  Advanced content will appear in practice resources. Basic resources will be included in public-facing RSS feeds.

* Optionally, restrict the content to legal aid members or pro bono members or both.  This will add an access layer to the content, requiring the user to be logged in with the correct role to view.

* Optionally, set the content to be a best bet for one or more search terms.  See :ref:`search-content-label`

* Optionally, set up to 3 recommended/related content nodes.  See previous page.

* Indicate whether you want the content to be translated.  This defaults to no.

* When editing English content, you can flag the translation as outdated.  This defaults to no.

* Optionally, set the last revised date.  When creating content, this will default to the current date/time.  When editing content, this should be updated whenever  staff user makes a substantive change to the content. Does not include typos, grammatical fixes, or style changes. Does include anything that adds or removes information, especially law changes.

* Optionally, set the last reviewed date/time.  When creating content, this will default to the current date/time. The last reviewed date when a subject matter expert has done a substantive review of the content to ensure legal accuracy. 

* For blog posts, set the author/subject matter expert.  

* Optionally, add appropriate content management tags.

* The word count will automatically update.  See :ref:`word-count-label`

* Set the status.  When creating content, it defaults to draft/revise.  Until published, it will not be visible on the website to users.

* A revision log message is required.
