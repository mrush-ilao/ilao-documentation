Drupal Blocks Overview
========================

Blocks are managed under Structure.

* Blocks layout => this is where block placement is managed
* Custom block library => this is where custom blocks are created and edited.





Placing a block
================

To place a block, go to Structure => blocks layout and click place block next to the region where the block should appear.

Note: if the block title needs to be hidden, from the configuration drop down next to the block where it appears, select "Configure" and uncheck the display title box.
