==================
Donation blocks
==================

We have three donation blocks available (additional blocks could be added):

* Donation-A
* Donation-B
* Donation-C (this is currently a copy of Donation-A)

Donation A is assigned to 250 pieces fo legal content, the home page, and a handful of other pages.

Donation B is assigned to 250 pieces of legal content and a handful of other pages.

Donation C is assigned to all pages other than those assigned to Donation A & B.

The 3 blocks are limited to English pages as they are not translated.

.. note:: To support different languages, we would first need to make copies of our donation forms on QGiv and translate those.  

To create a new block
=======================
Only one header block should appear on any given page.  To create a heading banner:

* Go to Structure => Block layout => Custom block library
* Add custom block
* Select basic
* Enter a block description; this is what appears in the block library as the name of the block
* Enter the body.   Use the header banner code below to provide the correct style.
* **DO NOT** add an image.

When placing the block:

* add the block to the Header section on the block layout page by clicking Place block
* the block must be ordered just above the disabled blocks to keep the block from interfering with menus, site slogan blocks.
* set the block CSS class to ilao-banner-block to cause it to display correctly full-width.

Header banner code
=====================

This is the code used in the header banner to provide the correct style.

.. code-block:: html
   
   <div style="background-color:#F8FAFA;width:100%; padding:20px;font-weight:bold;box-shadow: 0 0.125rem 0.5rem rgba(106,107,113,0.2);">
   <p style="padding-bottom:0;font-weight:bold;">
   Text goes here
   </p>
   </div>
   
It is possible to embed an image in the header such as: 

.. code-block:: html

   <div style="background-color:#F8FAFA;width:100%; padding:20px;font-weight:bold;box-shadow: 0 0.125rem 0.5rem rgba(106,107,113,0.2);min-height:135px">
   <img src="[img source]" style="vertical-align:middle;float:left" width="125px" />Text here</div>
   
.. note::  We added a minimum height to the div that is just slightly larger than the height of the image.
