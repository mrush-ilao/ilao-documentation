* Start and end date:  Either or both can be added.  This is based on intake created date.  There are some instances where this field is empty.  In those cases, the date will appear as 12/31/1969.  
* Organization:  Supports partial matches to the organization name
* Services:  Supports partial  matches to a location-services for an organization
* Legal issues:  Single select of a legal issue.  This field is slightly problematic in that it returns only instances where the selected term matches part of the user's drill down.  
* Source:  this is currently legacy from D7 site to include whether the user accessed the system from a program widget or the modal (neither of which are part of the D8 site)
* Intake status:  this is a multi-select for different intake statuses.  See the intake status legend below.
