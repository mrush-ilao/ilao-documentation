Triage
========================

The first piece of Get Legal Help is a triage system designed to route the user to resources.  To do this, we ask users to:

* provide their legal problem.  This can be accomplished by picking from our legal issues taxonomy OR typing in a keyword.
* provide their zip code.
* indicate whether they are looking for a lawyer, forms, or legal information
* if the user indicates they are looking for a lawyer:

  * they are required to provide a household size
  * once the household size is provided, an income level question will be required.  The amount used is an approximation of 300% of the federal poverty level, rounded to the nearest thousand.  This is used to determine the initial set of referral resources.
  * the user may indicate if they self-identify as a member of any specific population. The list of populations is maintained in our `intake populations taxonomy <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/intake_populations/overview>`_.  
  
* the user is required to accept terms & conditions.

When the user submits the form, the system:

Step 1: Evaluates the term entered by the user.  If the term:
  
  * is an exact match to lowest level legal issues taxonomy term, the system moves to step 2
  * is an exact match to a higher level legal issues taxonomy term, the user is provided a form based on the legal issues; once that has been completed, the system moves to step 2 
  * if neither of these are true, the user is taken to the top of our taxonomy tree to drill down to a lowest level legal issue before continuing to step 2.
  
Step 2:  Evaluates the type of help; if the user is seeking a lawyer, the system evaluates available resources as follows:

 * users who have indicated "Yes" to the income questions are directed to referrals unless there is an OTIS organization that is free to everyone service or a service where income limits are waived for specific populations
 * The system checks for available OTIS partners first (ahead of referrals).  This requires looking for:
   * an intake setting with a service area that matches the user's location
   * an intake setting that matches the user's legal issue
   * an intake setting that is published
   * an intake setting that has either no capacity limit or has not yet reached that limit
   * an intake setting that is either available to everyone or matches any selected populations the user identifies with
   * a triage rule that matches the service of the intake setting
   * a triage rule that matches the user's legal issue
   * a triage rule that is published
 
Step 3a:  When there is 1 or more OTIS matches, the system prioritizes based on:
  * Free to everyone and free to eligible persons services are prioritized ahead of low cost services
  * Services that match the user's population selections, if the user has selected those
  * When the last intake was completed.  Matches will be ordered by reverse last intake completed date so that organizations that have gone longer will get preferred.

.. note::  There will be some additional criteria when the user comes from a direct program referral.

Step 3b:  When there are no matches, the user is provided referrals.

When a user is diverted from Step 3a and there are multiple organizations, the user will be routed back to the next organization until there are no organizations they could apply to.
