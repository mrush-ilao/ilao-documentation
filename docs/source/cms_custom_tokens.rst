Custom Tokens
=========================

Custom tokens may be used in legal content when inserted manually in the format of [type:machine-name].

Custom tokens are managed under the `Structure <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/structure/token-custom>`_ section of the website.



Custom token types
=====================
Staff can create different types of custom tokens to better manage custom tokens.  Currently we have types of:

* Custom
* Process
* Custom-ES
* Custom-PL
* Process-ES
* Process-PL

.. note::  The machine name for each type is lowercase.  Uppercase is not supported.  

Adding and editing custom tokens
====================================

.. note::  Custom tokens are not translatable.  They can technically be translated but the translations can't be detected on the front-end. The approach then is to create separate tokens per language and then insert the correct language token in the legal content.

To create a token
-------------------

* Select the token type.  This will be the type part in [type:name].
* Enter a name.  This is the name for display.  It is not the name used in the token.  
* Enter the machine name ID.  Only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores may be used and each machine name ID must be unique.  **This is the name part of the token**
* Optionally, enter a description
* Enter the content.  
* Select the language code.  

.. note::
   You may need to view the source of the content to strip out paragraph tags for tokens that should be used in-line with other content, for example, tokens that are used mid-sentence or mid-paragraph.

Recommendations for Spanish and Polish tokens
================================================

The recommended approach for Spanish and Polish tokens is:

* Create the token in English first
* For Spanish, create the Spanish token using the -es token type that matches the English but use the English machine name (for example, custom:minimum-wage would be custom-es:minimum-wage)
* For Polish, create the Ppanish token using the -pl token type that matches the English but use the English machine name (for example, custom:minimum-wage would be custom-pl:minimum-wage)
* Set the language code to the correct language.

This approach will make it easier to update the tokens in content when translating.

Using custom tokens
========================

There is no tool in the WYSIWYG to automatically insert a custom token.  To add a token, just type it in the format of [type:name] where type is the custom token type and name is the token name. 

Examples
--------------
The custom token 45 times the federal minimum wage would be [custom:45-times-the-federal-minimum-wage]

The process token file-motion would be [process:file-motion]
