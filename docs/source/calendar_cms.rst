Adding an event
=====================

To create an event, a user must:

* Add a title (name of the event)
* Add the event's start and ending date/time
* Optionally, add a sponsoring organization.  This is a text field.

.. note:: In earlier versions of the website, events were tied to organizations with inherited permissions and a separate set of fields had to be used for independent events. Starting in 2020, events are associated with individuals and not tied directly to any organization-based permissions.

* Select the event format:

  * In person - this will then add a field for an address
  * Online/Webinar, Telephone - this wil then add a field for instructions
  * Alert/notice - this is usually for something that has no online or in person component.  Examples might be a window for a program, Pro bono week, etc.

* Add a required event description.  This is the general body for the event details.

* Optionally, add 1 or more speakers.

* Optionally, upload 1 or more files that will be attached to the event.  Once uploaded, you can add a description that will replace the file name when shown to the user.  Multiple files can be added, one at a time.

* Indicate if the user is registering or buying a ticket.  This is no longer used on the front end and will be removed in the future.
