======================
Fast Entry Form
======================

The fast entry form can be used to quickly refer users to OTIS partners, bypassing all triage rules and the standard online intake forms.

Fast entry permissions
========================

The global fast entry form is accessible at /get-legal-help/fast-entry but is only accessible to:

* ILAO staff

The referral fast entry form is accessible at /get-legal-help/[organization]/fast-entry* but is only accessible to:

* ILAO staff
* Logged in website users who have been given the fast entry member role within the organization settings for the OTIS partner organization by an organization manager of the OTIS partner organization
* [organization] is replaced with the organization's specific name or acronym. Ex. Prairie State Legal Services, Inc. = /prairie-state

.. note:: OAS/OTIS managers should be given the Fast Entry role to be able to see the form.

Adding a fast entry user
--------------------------
An OTIS manager or organization manager will need to:

* Invite the fast entry user to register on IllinoisLegalAid.org if the user is not already registered;
* Once the user has registered, add the user to their organization (group membership); and
* Give the user the fast entry user role in their organization:

Related Intake Settings
==========================
Because fast entry bypasses triage rules and intake settings generally, ILAO staff will associate a single intake settings ID per organization in the Legal Server configuration.  This intake setting should be an intake that is generally left open. The legal issue taxonomy selected in the intake setting will not impact the law type options on the fast entry form. This id will then be used for data tracking. Fast entry intakes will not impact counts on any intake settings.


Related Triage Rule
======================
The fast entry form is built using a single webform and is attached to a separate triage rule per organization.

* The triage rule should be named "[ORG] Fast Entry";
* The service of the triage rule should match the service for the intake setting selected above;
* "Law practice" should be selected from the legal issue taxonomy to prevent any potential conflicts;
* [Organization] should be added as the Group audience;
* Attach the "Fast entry intake form" webform to the triage rule; and
* Assign a URL alias /get-legal-help/[organization]/fast-entry
* [organization] should be the organization's commonly known acronum or short name.

Confirmation
=================
Fast entry forms will be treated as "we call client" and a field for callback times is collected via a preferred day/time field.

Data capture & reporting
==========================

On submission, the form will create an etransfer into legal server. Because there is no triage the data will be slightly different than triage intake:

* last_screen_viewed should be fast-entry
* county should be derived from zip_code
* state should be pulled from address fields

* legal problem should be stored in oas_triage_user__oas_triage_search (check this) 
* current count SHOULD NOT BE changed in intake settings when the record is saved.

Etransferred elements only
------------------------------
These are sent to LegalServer only and not stored as fields in ILAO's website (except as webform submissions):

* Client first, middle, last name
* Client date of birth
* Client address, phone
* Alias first, middle, last name
* veteran (true or false)
* disabled (true or false)

Notes only elements
