======================
Fast Entry Form
======================

The fast entry form can be used to quickly refer users to OTIS partners, bypassing all triage rules and the standard online intake forms.

Fast entry permissions
========================

The fast entry form is accessible at /get-legal-help/fast-entry but is only accessible to:

* ILAO staff
* Legal aid members who are also organization managers of an OTIS partner organization
* Website users who have been given the fast entry role within the organization settings of an OTIS partner organization by an organization manager of the OTIS partner organization

Adding a fast entry user
--------------------------
An OTIS manager or organization manager will need to:

* Add the user to their organization
* Invite the fast entry user to register on IllinoisLegalAid.org
* Once the user has registered, give them the fast entry user role in your organization:

Click on Manage your organization, locations, and services from your dashboard

and then click Group Membership

Related Intake Settings
==========================
Because fast entry bypasses triage rules and intake settings generally, ILAO staff will associate a single intake settings ID per organization in the Legal Server configuration.  This id will then be used for data tracking. Fast entry intakes will not impact counts on any intake settings.


Fast entry form
====================
The fast entry form is built using webform. 


Exit use cases
=================
Fast entry forms will be treated as "we call client" and a field for callback times is collected via a preferred day/time field.


Data capture & reporting
==========================

On submission, the form will create an etransfer into legal server. Because there is no triage the data will be slightly different than triage intake:

* current count SHOULD NOT BE changed in intake settings when the record is saved.

Etransferred elements only
------------------------------
These are sent to LegalServer only and not stored as fields in ILAO's website (except as webform submissions):

* Client first, middle, last name
* Client date of birth
* Client address, phone
* Alias first, middle, last name
* veteran (true or false)
* disabled (true or false)

Notes only elements
----------------------

* Add "Source: Fast-entry from [email address of logged in user]"
* Does client consent to text messages from referral organization should be appended to notes as "Client consents to text messages: Yes" or Client consents to text messages: No"
* Adverse party should be appended to notes as "Adverse party: [names]"

Not stored elements

If either of these are no, there should be no data saved at all and no eTransfer created.
