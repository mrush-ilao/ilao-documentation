==================
Live Chat
==================

Our live chat system is powered by Comm100.  

On our website
===============
Comm100 is configured on our website using a block in the footer region.

* `Configure the block <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/admin/structure/block/manage/comm100>`_ (choose where it shows up)
* `Edit the block <https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/block/266>`_ (update the JavaScript to include).  The Javascript is only visible if you click on Source in the WYSIWYG window.

The block is configured to:

* Show on English pages only
* Show for all authenticated and anonymous users
* Only in our main theme (which prevents it from showing on admin pages like the CMS)

.. note:: 

   The previous chat system allowed us to exclude users by role from seeing the Live chat icon and pop up (specifically staff and legal aid members).  The new system only allows us to include users by role.  Because all logged in users have the authenticated role and community members ONLY have the authenticated role, we can not disable that role.  This then results in the chat buttons appearing for all logged in users.


On Comm100
=============

Comm100 controls:

* Whether the chat icon appears on our website.  The icon disappears if no agent is logged into the Comm100 console.
* When the pop up appears (currently set after the user has been on the site for 30 seconds)
* What the chat button, pop up image, and chat box looks like and where it is placed on the site.

Comm100 also provides the JavaScript we include in our Drupal block to control Comm100.
