Using ILAO toolboxes
================================

How Toolboxes, tools, and tool steps are found
=================================================

.. note::  These access points need to be built out with the exception of from within portal pages and dashboards

Users can access toolboxes:

* From portal pages
* From search
* From their dashboards, for community and law student members

Users can access tools:

* From within legal resources pages 
* From toolboxes within portal pages
* From their dashboards, for community and law student members

Users can access tool steps:

* From their dashboards, for community and law student members
* From tool pages

Keeping Track of Progress
=============================

.. todo:: Reporting tools coming soon



Users who start a toolbox or tool will have records created in our website that captures:

* the language they accessed the content in
* the timestamp of the first activity
* the timestamp of the most recent activity
* their user ID (0 for anonymous users)

For each node viewed:

* the language the user accessed the content in
* the timestamp of the first activity
* the timestamp of the last activity
* a status of completed, started, or saved

  * Tool steps will have a status of started when the tool step is viewed and completed when the user marks it complete
  * Tools will have a status of started when the user first views the page and a status of completed when the user has marked.  If they accessed it from the toolbox form and did not start it, it will have a status of saved until they start.  
  
Website members
-----------------

For logged in members, their user ID is captured; this allows the user to return and pick up where they left off later.


Anonymous users
-----------------

For anonymous users, the data is captured but the user can not return and continue where they left off.  If they return to a tool, they will not see any completed progress from earlier sessions.


Offline Communications
==========================

Ticklers exist on the back-end to allow us to follow up with users who are in-progress on a tool via SMS and email.  But they need a lot of work before we reactivate them.

.. todo:: rebuild the tickler functionality

Users who complete a tool are provided the link to a `toolbox feedback survey <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/R6CHB8R>`_.
