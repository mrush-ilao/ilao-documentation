Spot Classsifer API Docs
=============================


The `LIT Spot classifier <https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/suffolklitlab/spot/>`_ is an API service that takes text and returns one or more legal problem codes based on the `LIST taxonomy <https://taxonomy.legal/>`_.  

Configuration in Drupal
========================
We have a configuration page that allows us to store:

* Our API key, required to interact with the classifier
* The URL for the classifier
* Whether to allow SPOT to save submitted text or not
* The cutoff values (lower, upper, and prediction)

Methods
=========
We currently support:

* /taxonomy which returns the labels of the LIST taxonomy in use in the classifier
* /entities-terminal and /entities-nested which accepts:

  * text (a string up to 5000 characters)
  * save-text (0 or 1; whether the classifier is allowed to save our text)
  * cutoff-lower (between 0-1; default 0); the lower prediction must exceed this to be returned
  * cutoff-pred (between 0-1; default .5); the prediction must exceed this to be returned
  * cutoff-upper (between 0-1; default .5); the upper bound of the prediction must exceed this to be returned.
  
.. note:: We will still need to build out the feedback loop to confirm correctness in a future iteration.
  
Entities-nested
----------------
Entities nested returns the entire LIST tree for a provided text.  For example, it might return Housing->Evictions from a home

Entities-terminal
------------------
Entities terminal returns only the lowest LIST terms that match a text.  For example, it might return Evictions from a Home but not the parent Housing term.

..note :: Not all levels of the LIST taxonomy are currently supported in the classifier.  


Example
==========

When using entities-nested, the results return the entire hierarchical chain of problem codes where they exist.
